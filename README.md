# Few-shot-learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains the codebase for a research project that focuses on autonomous detection of bearing failures in nuclear power plants using Deep learning with few shot learning algrithm. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and diagnose the condition of bearings from processed data.

## Files Description
- `data.py`: Script to import pre-processed data from MATLAB.
- `main.py`: Main script that orchestrates the model training and evaluation process.
- `net.py`: Contains the CNN architecture definitions and associated methods.
- `test.py`: Script used to evaluate the model's performance on test data.

## Getting Started
Describe here the steps to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the scripts.

## Data Processing
The data used in this project is pre-processed using MATLAB. `data.py` is responsible for importing this processed data into the Python environment.

## Model Training
`main.py` is used to train the CNN model. The training process involves addressing class imbalance issues to improve model performance.

## Evaluation
The `test.py` script is used to evaluate the trained model over different sample sizes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the few-shot learning algorithm.
